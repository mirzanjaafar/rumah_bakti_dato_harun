<h2>The Term of Orphans in terms of Islamic Sharia </h2>
<h4> As for according to the term syara', what is meant by an orphan is a child whose father died before he reached puberty. The limit or period for a child to be called an orphan is until the child reaches puberty and becomes an adult. For people who have grown up and then lost their parents are no longer called orphans because they are already able to support and take care of themselves. It is only suitable for children because they are not able to take care and support themselves and still need help and assistance from others.</h4>

<h2>According to Fath Al-Qarib and Al-Baijuri:</h2>
<h4>"An orphan means a small child (underage), who does not have a father, whether the child is a boy or a girl, whether he has a grandfather or not. This includes minor children, children of adultery, children of collection and children who are denied due to estrangement between husband and wife.
When he reaches puberty, he is not called an orphan, and he reaches puberty at the age of fifteen lunar years."
<br>
However, the Malaysian Malay community has another term, Yatim Piatu, which is meant as those who have lost both their mother and father, although this term is not actually in Islamic law.
Orphans are children whose father or both died when they were young or underage. Islam enjoins mankind to have a good relationship with orphans, provide protection and education and give them their rights.</h4>

<h2>The word of Allah which means:</h2>
<h4>"For this reason, you should not despise orphans." (Al-Dhuha)
<br>
"Do you know people who deny religion, that is, people who scold orphans." (al-Maun)
<br>
Islam also forbids eating the property of orphans in a cruel way as stated in Surah An-Nisa verse 6.</h4>

<br>
<h2>Social obligations</h2>
<h4>Loving and caring for orphans is a social duty of every Muslim. And it is one of the efforts of the Islamic struggle that people rarely do. Thus, social problems arise due to four reasons, namely not honoring orphans, not feeding the poor, greedily eating the heritage (wealth) of nature, and loving possessions excessively (see surah al-Fajr, verses 15-20).</h4>
